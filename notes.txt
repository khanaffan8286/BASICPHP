1. While loop is used for printing or implementing multiple value for example if you want to implement 1 to 10 number

$value = 1;
(while($value <10){
    echo $value;
    $value++;
})


2. do while loop it is used pring atleast one time if the loop is not anything it print atleast one time mean

$value = 10

do{
    echo "the value is $value";
} while($value <10);


3.Session (To store data in the browser to tansfer data from page to page)[syntax:$_session['']  
// before this we need to start the session  session_start()  and for end the close the session  session_unset()]


4.For cheking anything in the database we need mysqli_fetch_aasoc();


5.For connecting database ( $con = mysqli_connect('localhost','root','this is for password and for local it will blank','databasename')


6.For Insertion of the data we need mysql querry for that eg: $sql = "INSERT INTO database_name (data that you wnated to insert)"

7. Same for update eg: $sql  =  "Update database_name set name of the raw = you wanted to " 

8. Delete // $sql = "DELETE FROM form WHERE id = '$id'";

9. after this method we need to run a qurrey (mysqli_qurry($conn,$sql))
